# MIA-Notice

It's almost 1 year since I have last touched my GitHub account. Time really flies huh...

I guess there are many reasons why I wound up not being "immersed" in the world of programming again. 
Could blame it on work, could blame it on gaming;
Could even blame it on my girlfriend :P

But I guess I was just being lazy (and very verrrryyyy tired from work).

Nevertheless, I did learn a thing or two from time to time, and I decided that it would be good practice to note down what I learn here for future references.
And to remind myself how far I've come, just how vast this world is, and how I've only begun to scratch the surface.

Only time shall tell if I make it :D
